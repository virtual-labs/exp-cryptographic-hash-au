      "question": "What is a hash function?",

        "a": "A function that converts data of arbitrary size into a fixed-size string of bytes.",
        "b": "A function that encrypts data to ensure its security during transmission.",
        "c": "A function that compresses data to reduce its size.",
        "d": "A function that validates data integrity by appending a checksum."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! A hash function converts data of arbitrary size into a fixed-size string of bytes.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Hash functions do not encrypt data; they convert it into a fixed-size string of bytes.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While hash functions may appear to compress data, their primary purpose is to convert data into a fixed-size string of bytes.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Hash functions are primarily used for generating a fixed-size string of bytes from input data, rather than appending a checksum for data integrity."
